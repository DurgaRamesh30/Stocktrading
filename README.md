Secure Stock Trading Simulation System — Developed a Java-based console application that simulates a simplified stock trading platform with user account management, live market price simulation, and portfolio tracking. Implemented secure authentication using username–password credentials, enabling users to create accounts, buy and sell stocks, and view their holdings with real-time market updates. Designed the system using object-oriented principles with modular classes for User, Stock, Order, and TradingSystem, and persisted user data in JSON format via the Gson library to ensure data continuity across sessions. Enhanced code structure for maintainability, scalability, and potential future expansion (e.g., portfolio analytics and trade history).
